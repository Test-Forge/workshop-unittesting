/** An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly steps, for every step
 * it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill, step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up
 * or down represents a unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
 * <p>
 *  A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending
 *  with a step down to sea level.
 * <p>
 *  A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending
 *  with a step up to sea level.
 * <p>
 *  Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.
 * <p>
 * Input: int number of steps, string path containing "U" for uphill and "D" for downhill
 * <p>
 * Output: int number of valleys
